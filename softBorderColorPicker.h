/**
 * SoftBorderColorPicker: a functor that determines the color that should be used
 * given an `point`. If the given position is near a border of
 * the fill, then it should be colored with the required color. Otherwise, its color
 * should not change.
 *
 * The following criteria should be used to determine if a position p is near
 * a border: if p is within distance `borderwidth` of any cell that will be outside the
 * fill, then the pixel at position p should be colored with the average colour of
 * pixels of the original image within `borderwidth` pixels of p.
 *
 * You will use Euclidian distance to judge proximity. That means if p is at
 * location (x,y), its distance to a point at location (a,b) is
 * squareRoot([(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2]). Note that you should not ever have to
 * compute the square root to solve this problem.
